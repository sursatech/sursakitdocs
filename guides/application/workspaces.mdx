Workspaces are the working copies of your project where you edit files and run code.

## Create a workspace

1. From the home page or switcher, click New Workspace
2. Choose one or more services (sources):
   - Connect a Git repo
   - Upload a local folder
   - Start Empty (add files later)
   - Add a Database service
   - Import a Docker image
3. Name the workspace and confirm

## Duplicate a workspace

There isnâ€™t a built-in Duplicate action yet.

Workaround:
- Create a new workspace from the same service, or
- Upload the same folder to a new workspace

## Switch workspaces

Use the workspace switcher in the header of the project.

Sessions inside the workspace

- Each workspace has a default session called "main"
- Create new sessions from "main" for feature work
- Merge back to "main" when changes are ready

## Best practices

- Keep a "main" workspace stable
- Use additional workspaces for feature work or demos
- Archive workspaces you no longer need

An organization is the top-level space for your team and projects.

- Members: users who have been invited to the org
- Scope: projects, workspaces, and services belong to an org
- Access: org admins can invite/remove members and manage roles

Example: "Team Alpha" contains the "Marketing Demo" and "Data Tools" projects. Invite new teammates to Team Alpha to grant access.

Security and access

- Your code and data stay within the workspace — they don’t leave your environment
- Grant/revoke access via org membership; no device copies to manage

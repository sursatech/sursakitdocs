A service is the source your workspace uses. Most commonly itâ€™s a repository, but you can also create a service from an uploaded folder, start empty, connect a database, or import a Docker image.

- One workspace can include multiple services (e.g., frontend, backend, database)
- One service can also back multiple workspaces if reused
- Updating a service provides new code your workspaces can pull into sessions
- Types of services:
  - Repository (GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket)
  - Upload from local folder
  - Empty (start from scratch)
  - Database
  - Docker image

How it fits into the flow

1. Create a workspace (project)
2. Choose or add a service (source)
3. Create a session (branch) to do your work
4. Pull newer service changes into your session when needed

Best practices

- Keep services focused (one purpose per service)
- Reuse the same service across multiple workspaces for experiments
- Use an uploaded folder for quick demos or prototypes

Usage tips

- Prefer repos for ongoing work; use uploads for quick demos
- Keep naming consistent so teams can discover the right service

Examples

- "image-models" service (repo) is used by two workspaces: "Classifier A/B Test" and "Benchmark Suite"
- Upload a zipped folder as a service to quickly demo a customer prototype in a fresh workspace

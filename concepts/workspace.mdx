A workspace is your project. It’s where your team keeps code/files, creates branches of work (sessions), attaches sources (services), and runs things.

- Lives under an organization (you can have many)
- Holds files, settings, sessions, and services
- Persists between runs; open and manage from the application

Relationship to other concepts:

- Service (Repository/Source): what your workspace uses for code/data (e.g., frontend, backend, database, image)
- Session (Branch): a branch-like line of work within this workspace; default is "main"

How it fits into the flow

1. Create a workspace (your project space)
2. Add one or more services (sources) to it
3. Create a session (branch) for your work
4. Edit files and run; repeat until done

Working with workspaces

- Create: From the home page or switcher, click New Workspace and pick a service (or start empty)
- Add services later: Attach additional services when you need to compose multiple sources
- Create sessions: Start a new session to safely try changes without affecting your main work

Duplicate a workspace

- There isn’t a built‑in Duplicate action yet
- Workaround: create a new workspace from the same service(s), or upload the same folder to a new workspace

FAQ

- Can a workspace have multiple services? Yes — combine sources (e.g., "website-ui" + "api") in the same workspace
- What happens if I remove a workspace? It removes the project space; sources you connected remain available elsewhere
- Can I rename a workspace? Yes — rename to keep projects organized

Example

Create a workspace called "Marketing Demo". Attach the "marketing-site" service (repo) and an optional "customer-db" database service. Create sessions like "homepage-copy" and "cta-test" to try changes safely.

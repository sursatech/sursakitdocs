Sessions are branches for your workspace (project). They capture a line of work so you can switch contexts without losing progress.

- Create a session when starting new work
- Switch sessions to jump between tasks safely
- Merge changes from one session into another when ready

Scope and default branch

- Sessions live inside a single workspace (project)
- Each workspace has a default session called "main"
- New sessions typically start from "main" (or from another session)
- Creating a session does not duplicate the workspace; it creates a branch of work
- Merge your session back into "main" when ready

When to use a session vs a workspace

- Use a session for feature work or experiments within the same project
- Use a new workspace when the work is a separate project or needs different services

Example: In your "Marketing Demo" workspace, create sessions like "homepage-copy" and "cta-test". Work independently in each, then bring the best changes back to main.

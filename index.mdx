## What is SursaKit?

SursaKit is a browser-based coding workspace for teams.

- Build and run code directly in your browser
- Create workspaces (projects), invite teammates, and collaborate

## Who is it for?

- Teams building code-driven workflows and demos
- Developers who need reproducible workspaces
- Remote teams and founders working with freelancers

## Key capabilities

- Workspaces (projects) with sessions (branches) and services (sources)
- Real-time logs while you run
- Simple sharing and collaboration

## From anywhere, no setup

- Open your browser â€” no local installs
- Setup once, reused by everyone
- Onboarding/offboarding is instant access, not machine setup
